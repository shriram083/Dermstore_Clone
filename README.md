# Collaborative Project At Masai School “Dermstore.com”.

Before we start writing on the clone of the website, We want to thank Masai School for this great opportunity and for providing this great platform to enhance our
coding and intrapersonal skills. We have tried our level best to make use of our so far journey and the knowledge that we have gained so far at Masai School to come
up with our project.

## Getting Started…

It was a challenging journey for all of us as we have to complete it within the time of construct week, so we faced different challenges. So we started with planning and studying the website, then we distributed the workflow, the roles, and responsibilities and with great collaboration, we managed the work.

## Project Details -

We had to make a clone of Dermstore website. Dermstore was created in 1999 by a dermatologist who wanted to better serve his patients with easier access to the treatments their skin needed. Dermstore offer professional-strength formulas from top skin care brands (otherwise only available at a dermatologist’s office), hard-to-find spa care and natural beauty brands, professional hair care and makeup products, and specialty brands from around the world.

## Learnings -
We all became proficient in reading the code of team members. 
How to work and communicate with a team.
How to be more efficient and productive at the same time.
Here I get to know how the team works, how to keep cool even under pressure conditions, how to keep myself and my teammates motivated throughout the ups and downs.
At last, I would like to thank our mentors and my team members for their support & guidance during the project.
